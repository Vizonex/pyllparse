# pyllparse
A parody of llparse like pyppeteer that I made a couple months ago that I never got around to sharing or uploading.  Original was in typescript by Indutny

I have no plans on resumig this anytime soon. I did it more as a educational thing and I would've just gone ahead and dumped my code into a gist but that would be extremely big since there's three library involved with making llparse work alone. Translating it was difficult and there may be a couple of minor hiccups that I did not catch yet that do not mimic the same behaviors as llparse itself... I was also going to make a pxd compiler for this in the future but will have to wait and see. 

I take no credit for the orginal work done by indutny and I was very nervous about making this public...
