## ISSUE
<!-- Please give a short and sweet summary about the issue your experiencing -->

<!-- Fill this out too it's important for all of us to know what you want or what your goal is --> 
- [ ] bug
- [ ] optimization idea

## TO REPRODUCE
<!-- 
If this problem is not an optimization idea and is an issue, please 
create a short and sweet python script with the problem you are facing 
The script you create will be used to ensure llparse runs correctly and 
may even turn into a pytest testcase if your lucky. 

If it's an optimization idea use this place to brainstorm for me so I can get 
a picture of it in my head, it helps me develop things a bit better.

If possible send a typescript version of the code if you think the python version 
is somehow out of sync and I will attempt to try and fine-tune it or ask another contributor 
to help out.

```python 
from llparse import LLParse

def main():
    p = LLParse("my_parser")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
